# My Swift Apps 
This repository contains all my apps implementations in Swift using SwiftUI and UIKit.
There are three categories of apps, which depend on the difficulty of the implementation:
- Easy - roughly between 12 - 20 hours of making 
- Medium - couple of days to make
- Hard - could take weeks to make, maybe less - depends on the project
In the files there are modules that send you to another repository, where I keep track of my work on the application.
All apps are made for iOS 16 in Swift 5.8.

## Easy Apps
This is a great start of my learning and seeing how I can improve on my app making skills.
There are four apps in total:
- Countdown App
- Break Time Reminder App
- Mood Logging App
- To-Do List App

## Medium Apps

## Hard Apps
